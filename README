Overview

ColorPlus is a color management library with emphasis on dynamic filter creation and precaching.

Building & Installation

It is recommended to use ‘gb’ to build, but goinstall works as well. For more information, see https://code.google.com/p/go-gb/
To build with ‘gb’, simply enter the root directory and run ‘gb’. To install the package, run ‘gb -i’

To install using goinstall, run ‘goinstall github.com/nandykins/ColorPlus’

A default test suite can be accessed by running ‘gb -t’
